{"body":"# FAQ\r\n\r\n## Where is the Webplayer / Download list?\r\n\r\nRight now, these have to be inserted manually via so calles shortcodes. They are `[podlove-web-player]` and `[podlove-episode-downloads]`.\r\n\r\nThere are compatibility issues with the \"Jetpack\" plugin. If you use it, you might need to turn it off.\r\n\r\n## Where are my Feeds?\r\n\r\nGo to `Podlove > Shows` and look for the \"Feeds\" column. For everything to work correctly you **have to** set a show slug and a feed slug! The feed URL will then look like this: `http://www.mypodcast.fm/feed/<show-slug>/<feed-slug>\r\n\r\n## A Feed link directs me to a Blog page â€” What did I do wrong?\r\n\r\nNothing :) Go to `Settings > Permalinks`, hit save and try again.\r\n\r\n## How do I add Flattr Integration to my episodes?\r\n\r\n1. If you haven't already, get the official Flattr plugin here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flattr/\r\n2. Find the setting `Flattr > Advanced Settings > Flattrable content > Post Types` and check `podcast`. Save changes.\r\n3. There is no step 3 ;)","note":"Don't delete this file!
